# Text-to-Image-Compression

Script for converting text files to images.

The main idea behind the project is that it could in principle be used to obtain unlimited storage on the cloud storage of Google. By converting text files (and potentially other kinds of documents) to images, uploading these to Google Photos does not cost any storage space as long as the image file size is below a certain threshold (if above Google will compress the images).

Disclaimer: The project is to be considered a hobby project only and should not be used for the theoretical purpose described above as to not violate any terms of service of Google Photos.
